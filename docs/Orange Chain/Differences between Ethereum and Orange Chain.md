# Differences between Ethereum and Orange

Orange is built on the [Orange-Chain](https://github.com/Orange-Chain/orange-optimism) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is designed from the ground up to be as close to Ethereum as possible. Because of this, there are very few differences when it comes to building on Orange and Ethereum.

However, there are still some minor discrepancies between the behavior of Orange and Ethereum that you should be aware of when building apps on top of Orange.

These minor differences include:

- [Opcodes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [Blocks](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#blocks)
- [Network specifications](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Transaction costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)
